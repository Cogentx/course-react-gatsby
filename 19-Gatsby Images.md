## Gatsby Images

### Internet Challenges with Images

- too big
- width / height not right (ratio)
- poor loading perf
- not the right format (lots of formats)
- not compressed

#### Lossless Compression

Makes image as small as possible without loosing any quality

#### Lossy Compression

Makes image as small as possible but does give up some of the quality

### Gatsby Plugins

#### Gatsby-Plugin-Sharp

Exposes several image processing functions built on the Sharp image processing library. This is a low-level helper plugin generally used by other Gatsby plugins. You generally shouldnâ€™t be using this directly but might find it helpful if doing very custom image processing.

It aims to provide excellent out-of-the box settings for processing common web image formats.

**Further Description**

See Gatsby Docs ( <https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-sharp/> )

**Install**

`npm install gasby-plugin-sharp`

How to Use and Options

```javascript
        <Img fluid={pizza.image.asset.fluid} alt={pizza.name}></Img>
        <Img fixed={pizza.image.asset.fixed} alt={pizza.name}></Img>
```

This is related to the GraphQL query...

```javascript
export const query = graphql`
  query PizzaQuery {
    pizzas: allSanityPizza {
      nodes {
        name
        id
        slug {
          current
        }
        toppings {
          id
          name
        }
        image {
          asset {
            fixed(width: 200, height: 200) {
              ...GatsbySanityImageFixed
            }
            fluid(maxWidth: 400) {
              ...GatsbySanityImageFluid
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;
```
