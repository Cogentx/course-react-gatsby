#### Gotchas when working with Sanity and GraphQL

Error-Message: GraphQL API not deployed

Sanity by default has what is called a GROC API. If you want a GraphQL API (which is actually built with GROC) you need to deploy it by pressing on the link next to the error message in the terminal ( <https://www.sanity.io/docs/graphql> ).

(<https://www.sanity.io/docs/graphql#63c1424b5fc3>)

IMPORTANT: run the graphql deploy in SANITY terminal folder NOT in the GATSBY folder.

**Gotcha**
Keep in mind that changing the schema in your local Sanity studio does not automatically change the GraphQL API â€“ you'll have to run sanity graphql deploy to make the API reflect the changes.

### Deploying the GraphQL API

<https://www.sanity.io/docs/graphql#04501f1778aa>
Run sanity graphql deploy from your Sanity Studio project folder. This will deploy an API for the dataset configured in sanity.json. If you want to deploy to a different dataset, use the --dataset flag, eg: sanity graphql deploy --dataset staging.

_> terminal
`sanity graphql deploy`

This gives you a link to the playground in the terminal output

Click this link to go to playground and you'll see your Schemas listed which you can then query against.
