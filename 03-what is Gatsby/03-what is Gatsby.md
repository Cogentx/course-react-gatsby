## What is Gatsby?

React is a library

Gatsby is a framework; makes it easy to create modern websites
[Gatsby Homepage]<https://www.gatsbyjs.com/>

- build step in your website
- handles routing
- handles images
- static generator (generation is done at BUILD-TIME)
- uses react under the hood

Because all the HTML is done ahead of time; your website loads FAST

- Gatsby loads your CSS for your page before page load so no Flash of Unstyled Content

- you can have static code; then rehydrate in the browser and turn it into a fully dynamic React App

- routing and loading is built-in

- huge plugin ecosystem (youtube - embed and everything else)

Shortcomings

- you need to code Dynamic Pages in a certain way

- run through tool Lighthouse
- by default, you get a SEO, fast, accessible website
