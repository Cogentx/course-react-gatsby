# Master Gatsby

## What is Gatsby?

React is a library

Gatsby is a framework; makes it easy to create modern websites
[Gatsby Homepage]<https://www.gatsbyjs.com/>

- way to manage your data
- routing strategy
- build process
- build step in your website
- handles routing
- handles images
- static generator (generation is done at BUILD-TIME)
  - there a pre-generation built-in 
  - there is a build step in your website
  - HTML and CSS generated at build time so when the website is loaded it is already built so it loads very very fast
- uses react under the hood

Because all the HTML is done ahead of time; your website loads FAST

- Gatsby loads your CSS for your page before page load so no Flash of Unstyled Content

- you can have static code; then Gatsby rehydrates the code in your browser and turns it into a fully dynamic React App

- routing and loading is built-in

- huge plugin ecosystem (youtube - embed and everything else)


Shortcomings

- Gatsby is not currently a CMS; so we use Sanity in this course

- you need to code Dynamic Pages in a certain way

- run through tool Lighthouse
- by default, you get a SEO, fast, accessible website


### Gatsby Images

- Gatsby will lazy load your images
- as you scroll down a page the images are loaded as you scroll into view so you sometimes see them blury then come into focus quickly
- Gatsby converts your images to the modern formats
- this image work is extremely hard; Gatsby takes care of it for you and makes it easy

-  

### React Library

React is NOT a Framework; it is a library used for rendering out data to HTML DOM very quickly.
